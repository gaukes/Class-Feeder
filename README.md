Class-Feeder
============

Stalking telebears is a pain. This script automates the process and will find exactly the time when a class opens up and will run an alarm.

This project required Selenium for Python and Python 2.5+ to run. The computer must remain on and connected to the internet for the program to work. It can be run from the terminal. The administration is fixing telebears but until then, we have to deal with what we have.

Go Bears!
